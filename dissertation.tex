% This is an adapted version of J.J. Charfman's template which can be
% found here: https://da.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-arizona-astronomy-thesis-template/tsfqcgnfmjcx
% This template is adapted for linguistics. The uncommented line
% below will produce a Dissertation, the others would produce a Thesis
% or a Document.  There are other options available to you like turning
% on the copyright statement and replacing the year on the title page
% with a "generated on" stamp (handy for early drafts).  To find out
% what the available options are, take a look into the uathesis.cls
% file and look for the \DeclareOption commands near the top of that
% file.
% There are five copyright options.  Copyright, no copyright, and three
% different Creative Commons licences.  Use the one you want (If you go
% Creative Commons, I (DM) think the CC-BY-ND makes the most sense)  See
% uathesis.cls for the reason why the non-commercial licenses are not
% included.
\documentclass[dissertation,table,dvipnames]{uathesis} % we require tikz, which requires xcolor, if you want to load these packages with options, then do it as seen here. Any tikz or xcolor options need to be passed along here. Alternatively, you should also be able to load these packages explicitly

% Package Usage
% These are the packages that I recommend


%\usepackage{color} %broader color range and color options, allows you to define your
                    % own colors as RBG vectors


\usepackage{graphicx} % allows insertion of pictures etc



\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} %allows you to directly input utf-8 characters
                            % this means you can just type Árüz instead of \'Ar\"uz

                            
% \usepackage{natbib}
% \setcitestyle{semicolon,aysep={},yysep={,},notesep={:}} % natbib is available on most systems, and is
					% terribly handy.
					% We are using biber for this template, but leaving natbib in as an option
                    % if you want to use natbib instead of biber/biblatex, you need to 
                    % comment out the next package and the % addbibresource params
\usepackage[backend=biber,
                style=unified, % we are using the LSA unified style sheet here
                maxcitenames=2,
                maxbibnames=99,
                natbib]{bib latex}
\addbibresource{bibliography.bib}


\usepackage{tipa} %enables an IPA environment

\usepackage{qtree} %allows simple trees
\usepackage[linguistics]{forest} %allows more complex trees


\usepackage{fancyhdr} % cosmetics for better headings



% \usepackage{times}  %enable if you want to use a times font
\usepackage{amsmath} %this allows the use of \eqref{}, eqref will automatically put 
                    % brackets around your reference, which is great for referencing
                    % gb4e examples
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref} %allows to use references as links [hidelinks] makes sure there are no borders around the link, gives me \autoref


\usepackage{lscape}			% Used for making fitting large tables in by putting them landscape
\usepackage[tableposition=t]{caption} % (makes table captions normal size when font set smaller)


% \usepackage{enumitem} % allows advanced controls of tables and example numbering
		

% If you are using hyper-ref (recommended), this command must go after all 
% other package inclusions (from the hyperref package documentation).
% The purpose of hyperref is to make the PDF created extensively
% cross-referenced.
%allows to use references as links [hidelinks] makes sure there are no borders around the link, gives us \autoref
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}

\usepackage{gb4e} %manages example numbering, has to be last package in pre-amble, will break document otherwise

\include{custom-commands.tex} % we are hosting all the custom commands we are writing in a seperate file

% Set up some values.
\completetitle{}
\fullname{}			% Grad college wants your full name here.
\degreename{Doctor of Philosophy}	% Title of your degree.
\degreemajor{Linguistics} % Degree major

\counterwithout{footnote}{chapter} %disable this if you want your footnotes to reset their counter for each chapter

% the inlinetitle below will be used on the graduate college signature page if you uncomment it. 
% This is useful if your completetitle uses a linebreak or other command that would break an inline use of that title. 
% If you leave this commented it will do nothing. Uncomment and give it a value to activate. The change will be visible on page 2.

%\inlinetitle{}

\begin{document}

% tocdepth defines how many layers of sections/subsections are displayed in your table of content. The hierarchy works like this:
% Chapters (1)> Sections (2) > Subsections (3) > SubSubsections (4) > Paragraphs (5)
% Default = 4
%\setcounter{tocdepth}{5} 
% secnumdepth does the same work, except it numbers your sections. Chapters are automatically numbered, so setting this to 4 will give you numbered paragraphs. Default = 3
%\setcounter{secnumdepth}{4}



% Set up the title page
\maketitlepage
{DEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS}	% Title of your department.
{2019}							

% Insert the approval form.  Note that for electronic submission
% of your Ph. D. dissertation, you must bring *two* copies of the
% approval page to your final defense.  These must be signed by
% the committee.  Make two photocopies: one for the department
% and the other for your records.  Then, bring the two signed 
% originals to the graduate college when you submit the 
% final version of the dissertation to the University of Arizona.
% if you want to change the number of lines displayed, you need to do this in the uathesis.cls class, check the \approval command
\approval

\statementbyauthor
% If this is a Thesis, use the following form, with your thesis director's
% name and title in the square brackets like so (you should also omit the 
% approval form insertion above):
%\statementbyauthor[Jane M. Doe\\Professor of Chemistry]

% Include the ``Acknowledgements''
\incacknowledgements{acknowledgements}

% Include the ``Dedication''
\incdedication{dedication}

% Create a ``Table of Contents''

% Use the below if using natbib
% this is where your natbib stylesheet is referenced
%\bibliographystyle{sp-lsa.bst}	% S\&P bibliography style
% S\&P, an LSA publication, meets the LSA guidelines.  
% if you wish to use the UA citation style instead, call "uabibnat.bst" in the \bibliographystyle
