%This is where the body of your abstract goes, limited to 150 words
%for a thesis, and 350 words for a dissertation or document.  The
%word count limits apply to the regular Abstract in the thesis and
%to the separate Special Abstract.  Use the same text for both; just
%adjust the margins and heading.  The abstract should summarize your
%work.  The UMI booklet listed in the resources section of the U of
%A manual provides some writing tips.  The abstract for a dissertation
%or document may be longer than one page; word count is more important
%than page length in this section.

%If you are doing a paper submission, submit one copy of the special 
%abstract, and two extra copies of your title page, in the box with 
%the final copies of your thesis.  If you are doing an electronic
%submission, you can ignore the special abstract.
